# Create Vpc on AWS

A VPC, or Virtual Private Cloud, is basically a secure, custom network environment you can set up within a public cloud service.  Imagine it like having a private apartment building inside a giant public city.  You get the benefits of the public cloud's resources (like scalability and easy access) but with the added security and control of your own virtual network.  This makes VPCs ideal for things like storing sensitive data or running critical applications.
